Automated Herb Garden
This project aims to produce a fully automated herb garden. The system will control parameters such as light intensity and exposure, soil moisture and mineral content, and humidity. In later stages, the system will implement a learning strategy to observe the effect of cyclic light and moisture exposure to see if a simulated day/night cycle and seasonal rains significantly benefit growth rate/yield.
